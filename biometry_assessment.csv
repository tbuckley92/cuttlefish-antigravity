"Takes a history from the patient, performs focimetry if necessary, and determines options to achieve refractive goals"
Obtains patient's verbal consent
Uses a non-contact biometer and A scan ultrasonographer + keratometer; aseptic technique/topical analgesia used appropriately if required
Uses a contact biometer and A scan ultrasonographer + keratometer; aseptic technique/topical analgesia used appropriately if required
Demonstrates understanding of the importance of 'gates'/'cursors' and how to manipulate them. Calibrates biometry instrument and understands the medicolegal requirements for recording this
Interprets a biometry and A scan print out and is able to recognise where errors have been made in performing the biometry. Shows understanding of normal axial length and K readings and can recognise when the results lie outside normal range
Chooses an appropriate formula to calculate the power of the lens to be implanted
Gives correct advice to contact lens wearers about the time interval between last use and biometry
Uses appropriate settings on the biometry instrument; use appropriate formulae for patients who have had prior refractive laser procedures/silicone oil in the eye etc
